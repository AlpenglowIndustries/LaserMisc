The Wednesday image was a photo from the TV series that I downloaded and then cropped her out of the background, then heavily modified in Lightburn for decent engraving.  It may have been this one:

The word "Wednesday" is the logo from the TV series.

"Maker Chat" is a font called Lost.

The holes in her eyes are for a 3mm candle flicker red LED.

It was made for personal use, a white elephant gift in a maker group.

Made on a Thunder Nova 35 80W C02 laser.
